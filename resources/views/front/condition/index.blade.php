            To study the possibility of postponing a deadline, you can contact us by phone or from the contact form available on our website. The deferral interest income at the current rate, the premium application for the credit guarantee will be calculated if the insurance was purchased. You can request the postponement of one or two installments per year and thus benefit from a "pause refund". You must make the request 7 days before the next deadline. This pause payment will be granted provided that at the time of your request to postpone your revolving credit shows no unpaid or late payment, is not covered by insurance and that you do not have benefited from deferral in the previous 2 months.</p><br>
